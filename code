//This is a simple program that uses 3 recursive functions.
//The first function is a recursive function that takes a number and returns the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
//The second function is a recursive function that takes a number and returns the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number squared.
//The third function is a recursive function that takes a number and returns the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number cubed.
