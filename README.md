# Recursion

Write ONE (ONLY ONE) C++ program that will have 3 functions. All of them MUST BE recursive functions that will solve the following problems.  The user should be able to select which function they want to use when the program begins

Function 1 (Name: Reverse). It will ask for a word and you will need to use recursion to reverse the word and print it out.

Function 2 (Name: Factorial). It will ask for a number and print out the factorial of that number. EXAMPLE: 10 factorial = 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3628800. Make sure you use data types that can hold large numbers!

Function 3 (Name: Summation). It will ask for a number “n”, where n>3 , and it will compute the summation of multiples of 3 up to n.

Important: Any Problem not solved recursively will receive ZERO Points.
